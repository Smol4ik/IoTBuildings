# IoTBuildings
In the Cisco Packet Tracer program, a network was designed for two IoT buildings connected to a single internet provider. A DHCP server was set up to assign IP addresses to nodes, while the servers themselves had static addresses. The buildings had different servers to which IoT devices were connected. To simplify access to these servers, DNS was configured. The buildings featured motion detection systems and fire alarm systems that sent alerts to users via email in case of emergencies. An email server was set up to enable these notifications.
